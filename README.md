## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Fluid space & typography
- SASS and CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma first workflow

### What I learned

- Container queries for 'Fluid Space & Typography' would be helpful.
- Transparent border to show a visible boarder on hover that does not make the layout jump.

#### Fimga
- Starting in Figma is helpful. If you think in components, you take some work out of the front-end. Auto-Layout (aka Flexbox) makes the whole thing simple and clean.
- The inspect mode in Figma makes hand-off easy and seamless.
- Frames as spacers in combination with Auto-Layout: but these could also be their own components (spacer hierarchy).
